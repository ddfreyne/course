Also 'assumptions', but I like the term hypothesis better because it emphasizes that we don't take a side as to whether it is true or not. We specifically want to generate evidence that will either prove or disprove it.

*	Explicit: You need to be able to state it succinctly (on a post-it note);T;

;T;	I"### Welcome to COSI 235A - IT Entrepreneurship

The course this fall has been fully updated and incorporates two key new components. 

1. We will go in-depth on the "Lean Startup" model of entrepreneurship. This model is strongly focused on rapid iterations and validated learning. We will "go outside the building" to confirm (or refute) our hypotheses. A hypothesis in this context is a belief about the business we are consideringn starting up. A belief about a problem a user has, or a price they are willing to pay.
2. We will cycle twice through the Lean Startup process. First, during 4 weeks, we will rapidly learn the approach and terminology while attacking a product concept that I will supply (I hope you like it :). We will divide the class into two teams, and each one will work semi-independently on fleshing out the business plan. The second time through, students will apply the same process on a product of their own conception. We will form 2-3 person teams, ideate, validate, design, and document a full business model for the product, up to and including an actual validated prototype.(By the way, the prototypes and business models are the starting point of the companion course, "Software Engineering for IT Entrepreneurs which I will be teaching in the Spring.")

#### Other topics

* We will learn and practice how to create static and working prototypes which are critical in the process of validated learning
* We will explore basic finance as it applies to startups, especially as it relates to Venture Capital and company financing, as well as pricing and sustainability.

#### Speaker Series

<p>The term is organized as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Week 1: <em>Welcome</em>: warmups, introductions, etc. During this week (really just one class) we introduce the process we will go through and also go over the <em>Approval Checklist</em> that each product that we pursue, starting in <em>Frame 1</em> will have prepared and gotten okâd.</li>
  <li>Week 2,3,4,5: <em>Pilot Frame</em>. During these four weeks we will use a product contept that I supply (I hope you like it) to practice the key techniques of Lean Startup. In parallel and at the same time you will be introduced to these key concepts and have a chance to put them into practice.</li>
  <li>Week 6: <em>Ideation and Kickoff</em>: All along you will have been thinking and exploring what product or service you would like to propose. During this week we will see what everyone came up with, pick the best ones, and choose teams of 2 or 3 students to pursue the products. The work on these products will be the backbone of the rest of the semester culminating in a <em>Product Showcase</em></li>
  <li>Week 7,8,9: <em>Frame 1</em> During this frame the teams get themselves organized. Identify your key hypotheses and determine how to go about testing them. Prepare the artifacts needed to test the hypotheses and begin the process of âgoing out of the building.â</li>
  <li>Week 10,11,12: <em>Frame 2</em> During this frame the teams begin in earnest to determine how and whether to design and architect the product. You will be doing paper prototyping or using online prototyping tools, using these to test our <em>hypotheses</em> by <em>going outside the building</em>. We also now consider our Engine of Growth and develop the financial model to test and validate.</li>
  <li>Week 13,14,15: <em>Frame 3</em> During this final frame we pull everything together. Student teams refine their product business plans and prepare the final deliverables in preparation for the <em>Product Showcase</em>.</li>
</ul>

;T;	I"5### High Level Overview

The term is organized as follows:

* Week 1: _Welcome_: warmups, introductions, etc. During this week (really just one class) we introduce the process we will go through and also go over the _Approval Checklist_ that each product that we pursue, starting in _Frame 1_ will have prepared and gotten ok'd.
* Week 2,3,4,5: _Pilot Frame_. During these four weeks we will use a product contept that I supply (I hope you like it) to practice the key techniques of Lean Startup. In parallel and at the same time you will be introduced to these key concepts and have a chance to put them into practice.
* Week 6: _Ideation and Kickoff_: All along you will have been thinking and exploring what product or service you would like to propose. During this week we will see what everyone came up with, pick the best ones, and choose teams of 2 or 3 students to pursue the products. The work on these products will be the backbone of the rest of the semester culminating in a _Product Showcase_
* Week 7,8,9: _Frame 1_ During this frame the teams get themselves organized. Identify your key hypotheses and determine how to go about testing them. Prepare the artifacts needed to test the hypotheses and begin the process of "going out of the building."
* Week 10,11,12: _Frame 2_ During this frame the teams begin in earnest to determine how and whether to design and architect the product. You will be doing paper prototyping or using online prototyping tools, using these to test our _hypotheses_ by _going outside the building_. We also now consider our Engine of Growth and develop the financial model to test and validate.
* Week 13,14,15: _Frame 3_ During this final frame we pull everything together. Student teams refine their product business plans and prepare the final deliverables in preparation for the _Product Showcase_.;T;

;T;	I"### Welcome to COSI 235A - IT Entrepreneurship

The course this fall has been fully updated and incorporates two key new components. 

1. We will go in-depth on the "Lean Startup" model of entrepreneurship. This model is strongly focused on rapid iterations and validated learning. We will "go outside the building" to confirm (or refute) our hypotheses. A hypothesis in this context is a belief about the business we are consideringn starting up. A belief about a problem a user has, or a price they are willing to pay.
2. We will cycle twice through the Lean Startup process. First, during 4 weeks, we will rapidly learn the approach and terminology while attacking a product concept that I will supply (I hope you like it :). We will divide the class into two teams, and each one will work semi-independently on fleshing out the business plan. The second time through, students will apply the same process on a product of their own conception. We will form 2-3 person teams, ideate, validate, design, and document a full business model for the product, up to and including an actual validated prototype.(By the way, the prototypes and business models are the starting point of the companion course, "Software Engineering for IT Entrepreneurs which I will be teaching in the Spring.")

#### Other topics

* We will learn and practice how to create static and working prototypes which are critical in the process of validated learning
* We will explore basic finance as it applies to startups, especially as it relates to Venture Capital and company financing, as well as pricing and sustainability.

#### Speaker Series

Every (other?) week there will be an invited speaker during class. These will be local entrepreneurs, CEOs and CTOs who will give their personal perspectives, insights and stories.

I will try to give everyone constant and actionable feedback. I also expect you to be proactive if you are unclear about something or want to talk about anything. 

1. Class Participation (20%): This includes basic things like being in class when it starts, participating in the discussion, speaking up and contributing through blog posts and responses.

2. Product/Service (40%): How well did you and your team apply the Lean Startup techiniques and other concepts we covered to your product or service work. How well did you listen to feedback from prospects, experts and incorporate those ideas into your project. How good was your final deliverable?

The term is divided into chunks which I call frames (play on the word "framework"). There are four major frames. In the Pilot frame we will rapidly go through the leann startup process as applied to the Pilot product, "Peer-to-peer Location Aware Travel Guide". 

Then we will break into teams of 2 or 3 and work on individual projects of your own invention. That work will be structured and guided in 3 frames.

Also 'assumptions', but I like the term hypothesis better because it emphasizes that we don't take a side as to whether it is true or not. We specifically want to generate evidence that will either prove or disprove it.
