;T;	I"### Welcome to COSI 235A - IT Entrepreneurship

The course this fall has been fully updated and incorporates two key new components. 

1. We will go in-depth on the "Lean Startup" model of entrepreneurship. This model is strongly focused on rapid iterations and validated learning. We will "go outside the building" to confirm (or refute) our hypotheses. A hypothesis in this context is a belief about the business we are consideringn starting up. A belief about a problem a user has, or a price they are willing to pay.
2. We will cycle twice through the Lean Startup process. First, during 4 weeks, we will rapidly learn the approach and terminology while attacking a product concept that I will supply (I hope you like it :). We will divide the class into two teams, and each one will work semi-independently on fleshing out the business plan. The second time through, students will apply the same process on a product of their own conception. We will form 2-3 person teams, ideate, validate, design, and document a full business model for the product, up to and including an actual validated prototype.(By the way, the prototypes and business models are the starting point of the companion course, "Software Engineering for IT Entrepreneurs which I will be teaching in the Spring.")

#### Other topics

* We will learn and practice how to create static and working prototypes which are critical in the process of validated learning
* We will explore basic finance as it applies to startups, especially as it relates to Venture Capital and company financing, as well as pricing and sustainability.

#### Speaker Series

Every (other?) week there will be an invited speaker during class. These will be local entrepreneurs, CEOs and CTOs who will give their personal perspectives, insights and stories.

<p>The course this fall has been fully updated and incorporates two key new components. </p>

<ol>
  <li>We will go in-depth on the âLean Startupâ model of entrepreneurship. This model is strongly focused on rapid iterations and validated learning. We will âgo outside the buildingâ to confirm (or refute) our hypotheses. A hypothesis in this context is a belief about the business we are consideringn starting up. A belief about a problem a user has, or a price they are willing to pay.</li>
  <li>We will cycle twice through the Lean Startup process.

<p>The term is divided into chunks which I call frames (play on the word âframeworkâ). There are four major frames. In the Pilot frame we will rapidly go through the leann startup process as applied to the Pilot product, âPeer-to-peer Location Aware Travel Guideâ. </p>

<p>Then we will break into teams of 2 or 3 and work on individual projects of your own invention. That work will be structured and guided in 3 frames.</p>

;T;	I"### Detailed Framework

The term is divided into chunks which I call frames (play on the word "framework"). There are four major frames. In the Pilot frame we will rapidly go through the leann startup process as applied to the Pilot product, "Peer-to-peer Location Aware Travel Guide". 

Then we will break into teams of 2 or 3 and work on individual projects of your own invention. That work will be structured and guided in 3 frames.

      <h3 id="welcome-to-cosi-235a---it-entrepreneurship">Welcome to COSI 235A - IT Entrepreneurship</h3>

<p>The course this fall has been fully updated and incorporates two key new components. </p>

<ol>
  <li>We will go in-depth on the âLean Startupâ model of entrepreneurship. This model is strongly focused on rapid iterations and validated learning. We will âgo outside the buildingâ to confirm (or refute) our hypotheses. A hypothesis in this context is a belief about the business we are consideringn starting up. A belief about a problem a user has, or a price they are willing to pay.</li>
  <li>We will cycle twice through the Lean Startup process. First, during 4 weeks, we will rapidly learn the approach and terminology while attacking a product concept that I will supply (I hope you like it :). We will divide the class into two teams, and each one will work semi-independently on fleshing out the business plan. The second time through, students will apply the same process on a product of their own conception. We will form 2-3 person teams, ideate, validate, design, and document a full business model for the product, up to and including an actual validated prototype.(By the way, the prototypes and business models are the starting point of the companion course, âSoftware Engineering for IT Entrepreneurs which I will be teaching in the Spring.â)</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="other-topics">Other topics</h4>

<ul>

;T;	I"### Welcome to COSI 235A - IT Entrepreneurship

The course this fall has been fully updated and incorporates two key new components. 

1. We will go in-depth on the "Lean Startup" model of entrepreneurship. This model is strongly focused on rapid iterations and validated learning. We will "go outside the building" to confirm (or refute) our hypotheses. A hypothesis in this context is a belief about the business we are consideringn starting up. A belief about a problem a user has, or a price they are willing to pay.
2. We will cycle twice through the Lean Startup process. First, during 4 weeks, we will rapidly learn the approach and terminology while attacking a product concept that I will supply (I hope you like it :). We will divide the class into two teams, and each one will work semi-independently on fleshing out the business plan. The second time through, students will apply the same process on a product of their own conception. We will form 2-3 person teams, ideate, validate, design, and document a full business model for the product, up to and including an actual validated prototype.(By the way, the prototypes and business models are the starting point of the companion course, "Software Engineering for IT Entrepreneurs which I will be teaching in the Spring.")

#### Other topics

* We will learn and practice how to create static and working prototypes which are critical in the process of validated learning
* We will explore basic finance as it applies to startups, especially as it relates to Venture Capital and company financing, as well as pricing and sustainability.

#### Speaker Series

Every (other?) week there will be an invited speaker during class. These will be local entrepreneurs, CEOs and CTOs who will give their personal perspectives, insights and stories.

;T;	I"### Detailed Framework

The term is divided into chunks which I call frames (play on the word "framework"). There are four major frames. In the Pilot frame we will rapidly go through the leann startup process as applied to the Pilot product, "Peer-to-peer Location Aware Travel Guide". 

Then we will break into teams of 2 or 3 and work on individual projects of your own invention. That work will be structured and guided in 3 frames.

;T;	I"### Detailed Framework

The term is divided into chunks which I call frames (play on the word "framework"). There are four major frames. In the Pilot frame we will rapidly go through the leann startup process as applied to the Pilot product, "Peer-to-peer Location Aware Travel Guide". 

Then we will break into teams of 2 or 3 and work on individual projects of your own invention. That work will be structured and guided in 3 frames.

"For tourists visiting a new destination, who want to supplement their experience with local knowledge, NewProd offers local and knowledgable audio guides automatically based on location"

"For local professional and non-professional guides, Newprod is a way for them to discover new paying customers by providing location based audio tour segments which produce leads and also bolster reputation."

*	The sentence specifically answers some key questions:

	*	How does it achieve that?

Notice that this is an 'internal' statement, never meant to be shown to customers or even investors.

In this case we have two sentences because there are two distinctive markets. This raises very interesting pricing questions.

#### Homework due for today

**Note for first day of class:**{: style="color: red"} Each day of class has a page on this web site. The first section of that page is always the homework due on that very day. So in other words, the homework listed here is actually "pre-work" for day one. We will go over this in a little more detail during class.

1. **Piazza Blog Post**: Read article by Paul Graham about [How to get startup ideas](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html). Write a blog post reflecting on the article, what you liked, or didn't. (3 paragraphs max)
2. **Personal Statement**: Why are you taking this class? Why are you getting a COSI degree? What do you see yourself doing after graduating? What excites you about this field? Do you think of yourself as an entrepreneur?

*Please give this a little thought. It will become important when I challenge you to come up with a product or service idea. It will also be important to me to understand how to lead the class. Submit this as a  post.*
