title: Incubator Framework
section: incubator
order: 3
---
As you know this course has a major applied component which I refer to as The Incubator. Here we try to apply the Lean Startup conceptual framework to an actual product of your invention. We begin that process during the 5th (+/-) week of the class, after we've completed a break-neck review of the lean startup approach.

The Incubator will run over three 4 week periods, with each period encompassing a "frame" - hence - "Framework"! Don't worry if you have to pivot once or twice!

##### Frame 1

Deliverables:

* A name for the product
* One sentence summary of product
* An "Elevator Pitch" for the product
* A Validation board with testable hypotheses about the customer and the problem
* Design and conduct 'experiments' to test hypotheses
* Weekly "Status Update" post in Piazza, tagged "update"
* A 7 minute presentation showing your progress and status

##### Frame 2

Deliverables:

* A visual mockup or paper prototype to use in further experiments and as input to the design
* An architectural diagram of the product, site, app or service. An idea of how it could be built
* Continued refinement of the 'validation board'. More hypotheses should be tested and more exposure to outside feedback.
* Weekly "Status Update" post in Piazza, tagged "update"
* A 7 minute presentation showing your progress and status

##### Frame 3

Deliverables:

* A concept for the pricing of the product. This has its start in hypotheses that are tested.
* A basic revenue model that shows whether or not this product may lead to a sustainable business and how
* Weekly "Status Update" post in Piazza, tagged "update"
* A 7 minute presentation showing your progress and status
