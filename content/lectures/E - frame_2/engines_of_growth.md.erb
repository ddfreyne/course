##### Homework due for today

1. Dave McClure can be very annoying to listen to. He's given this talk many many times and many can be found on youtube and vimeo. He talks about (what he calls pirate-) metrics. When you listen to the talk you will understand why. I checked out three or four of them and this one, which runs around 20 minutes is one of the less annoying ones. 
	* [Listen to Dave McClure on Metrics that Matter](http://vimeo.com/6925856). <%= deliverable "A piazza blog post summarizing the key learnings from the presentation." %>

##### Review

* Why metrics are important
* Vanity vs. Actionable metrics
* Which of these is best?
	* 1M one time unregistered unique visitors?
	* 500K visitors who view 2+ pages / stay 10+ seconds?
	* 200K visitors who clicked on a link or button?
	* 20K registered users with email adddresses?
	* 2K passionate fans who refer 5 users / month
	* 1K monthly subscribers @ $5 per month.
* How to think about this
	* You need to know what you are trying to optimize for
	* Then you need to figure out what changes improve those variables
	* Only then can you tell if it's a good thing that you have more users today!
	* <%= discussion "What are some examples of metrics? How could we tel if they are vanity or not?" %>
