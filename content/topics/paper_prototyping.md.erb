##### Paper Prototyping
* There are many media for doing this. 
	* See lots of examples of [paper prototyping here](http://www.google.com/search?q=paper+prototyping&hl=en&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&prmd=imvnsb&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=slDNT5TgBIW16AHc293MAg&ved=0CGYQsAQ&biw=1251&bih=840)
	* An interesting article: [Paper Prototyping](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/paperprototyping/)
* Advantages
	* Very cheap which saves money
	* But also makes it less painful when it has to be changed totally
	* Allows a user to take over and cross things out and suggest other ideas
* You can take this as fas as you want.
	* Smaller snippets for the various ui widgets (e.g. drop down menus)
	* Make a "screen flow diagram" by connecting the different sheets of paper with lines showing the transitions
	* It is similar to a movie 'storyboard'

###### Here is my example: not good UI.

##### Conducting a usability test
* Whenever you are testing your product for usability
	* This could be testing a paper prototype 
	* early, when it is easy to make big modifications,
	* or later with actual software - when it's more difficult to make changes
* Rules of thumb to follow
	* Try to get the 'victim' to narrate their thought process
	* Make sure they know that if they are confused, it is the fault of the software, not their fault
	* If and when they get stuck, engage them in a conversation by giving them small hints
	* Ask them for a suggestion on how it would be clearer, for example:
	* "Let's say you want a plain pizza and you see this screen, what would you do?"
	* "Oh you can't decide, well tell me, what are you looking for right now on the screen?"
* Don't guess!
	* "Get out of the buiidling"! It's so much easier to grab one or two or more real humans
	* Evidence from 2 or 3 random people is often enough, but really you don't need for than 5-10..
