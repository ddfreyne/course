##### Market Segments
* Why is it important to think about them?
	* What is a 'market' in this context?
	* How do you think about the market size?
	* Look at segments, value proposition and market entry

* Segments: For your market or customer hypothesis, you need to understand the market(s) and segment(s) you are serving.
* Notice that these are not black and white, they can be continuums or multi-faceted.

##### Types of segments
* **Mass Market:** Huge and undifferentiated. Horizontal, e.g. consumers age 12 to 18.
* **Niche:** Highly specific: Vertical, e.g. Bicyclists
* **Segmented:** your product serves more than one segment. Apple serves the consumer and education market segments
* **Diversified:** your product serves very different markets: Amazon serves consumers and software developer
* **Two or multi-sided markets:** brings two or more segments together: dating services, newspapers. [story of early NeXT computer and Improv]

There are others. You need to understand the market you are going for

##### Market segmentation
* It is *not about* demographics or geographics
* A market segment is characterized as a group of people who:
	* "Speak the same language" (e.g. CIO vs. a hacker)
	* "Hang out" in the same "place" (e.g. College campus vs. Facebook)
	* They are similarly passionate or experience the pain at similar levels
	* They expect similar distribution (e.g. web vs. retail)
	* They expect similar levels of service (e.g. email vs. housecalls)
