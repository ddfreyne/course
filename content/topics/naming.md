##### Naming
* Caution: naming can be the biggest timesync
* Caution: Keep your life simple and choose the same name for your product and company
* Tip: Initially pick a dumb codename ("Project Alpha") that has no meaning and you know you are not going to keep
* At the start you don't know yet what your product *is* so you really can't pick the real right name yet, anyway.
* Tip: For $0 get bit.ly/project_alpha (etc). Easy to say and remember. Gives you a shortened URL to your product.
* Tip: For $10 get some domain name that's available even if you know it's not your real final name.
* Your goal: have a domain name that is easy for you and your listener to remember and to share over the phone. System X or Brandeis 007 are just as good as anything.
