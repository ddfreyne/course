##### Crossing the Chasm
* A concept that reminds us that the way we 'approach' a market changes depending on the maturity of the market
	* From a a famous book: [Crossing the Chasm, by Michael Moore](http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Geoffrey-Moore/dp/0060517123/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1309833093&sr=1-1), considered a seminal work

		* [Technology Adoption LifeCycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_lifecycle)

* Key Lessons
	* Realize where you are in the adoption cycle. Each stage calls for a different approach
	* Realize that each stage gets information from fans in the previous stage so you need to really make sure
		* They are fans
		* They communicate with the next stage
	* Growth can easily stall when going from Early Adopters to Early Majority
* Innovators and Early adopters (Earlyvangelists)
	* Seek out new technology to solve their (or their companies’) problems, not just for the sake of owning the newest technology.
	* Don’t rely on references from others to make buying decisions. While they are in- fluenced by other early adopters, their main concern is solving a known problem.
	* Eric Ries and Steve Blank call Early Adopters ["Earlyvangelists"](http://steveblank.com/2010/03/04/perfection-by-subtraction-the-minimum-feature-set/) to reflect that they are your biggest evangelists.
