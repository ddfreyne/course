##### Value Proposition / Positioning / Elevator Pitch

* Positioning and Value Proposition and Elevator Pitch
* All different sides of the same coin, used differently
* These definitions are not precise and the terminology is not set in stone.
* People will argue about them but you need to be familiar with how to talk about your product effectively.

##### Value Proposition Statement

"For tourists visiting a new destination, who want to supplement their experience with local knowledge, NewProd offers local and knowledgable audio guides automatically based on location"

"For local professional and non-professional guides, Newprod is a way for them to discover new paying customers by providing location based audio tour segments which produce leads and also bolster reputation."

*	The sentence specifically answers some key questions:
	*	Who is it for?
	*	What is their problem, what is the job their looking to hire a product for?
	*	What is the proposed solution?
	*	How does it achieve that?

Notice that this is an 'internal' statement, never meant to be shown to customers or even investors.

##### Positioning
* A pithy statement that summarizes the way you want people to think about your product or service.

##### Elevator Pitch

* An elevator pitch is meant to be spoken or read to a potential investor or board member
* You should have it at the tip of your tounge so when you run into the president you can answer the question: "So, what's your business do?" in a clear, interesting, catchy, provocative manner.
* Your goal is that they say, "Tell me more!", or "Please show it to me!", or best, "I need one of those, I will pay anything for it!"
