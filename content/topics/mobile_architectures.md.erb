##### Taxonomy of mobile applications

Depending on need, mobile apps can be structured quite differently

* Untethered
	* Example: Angry Birds game
	* Server: never or rarely requires one
	* UI paradigm: must be a Local App
	* Difficulty: Can be the easiest, although there are super complex and rich games

* Mashup like
	* Example: iPhone stock application
	* Server: uses other people's servers, using web services. 
	* Connection required, either constantly or to cache information
	* Login/Authentication. Privacy.

* UI paradigm: local or web based UI
	* Difficulty: additional complexity because your app is talking to someone else's server
	* Pure web-ui
	* Example: GMail application on iPhone
	* Server: requires your own server, and connected all the time
	* UI paradigm: web based UI, by definition
	* Difficulty: You save a lot of trouble by not having to develop local app. Much less mobile platform dependence

* Mobile front end to rich web app
	* Example: Facebook app on iPhone and Android
	* Server: your own server, providing it's own user experience, plus a connection to the mobile app
	* UI paradigm: web based or local app
	* Difficulty: One of the most difficult. You need to design two separate and complete user experiences

* Rich app
	* Example: Instagram
	* Server: requires your own server, with intermittent or constant connection
	* UI paradigm: local App by definition. There is no user interface for the 'server' or 'service'
	* Difficulty: Significant challenge to provide all the functionality over limited device.
