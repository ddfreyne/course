I will try to give everyone constant and actionable feedback. I also expect you to be proactive if you are unclear about something or want to talk about anything. 

1. Class Participation (20%): This includes basic things like being in class when it starts, participating in the discussion, speaking up and contributing to the overall success of the course.

1. Pilot Project (20%): This will be a 5 person team grade. The measure will be how well each of the key concepts of Lean Startup are understood, how good a job the team does with conceptualizing and realizing the lean startup approach, and the results as presented in the final presentation.

1. Product/Service (40%): How well did you and your team apply the Lean Startup techiniques and other concepts we covered to your product or service work. How well did you listen to feedback from prospects, experts and incorporate those ideas into your project. How good was your final deliverable?

4. Writing and Blogging (20%): Throughout the course there will be writing and blogging assignments. These will be posted to Piazza.
