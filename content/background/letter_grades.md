At the middle and end of the term you will receive letter grades. It's important to remember that a "B" is a totally reasonable grade (everyone always seems to forget this!) 

To help with that, here's a brief summary of how I think about each grade:

* *In Class participation*
	* "A" participation:
		* participates actively in class, without dominating the discussion asks insightful questions, makes illuminating remarks, listens to others and responds appropriately
		* works responsibly as a member of a group (e.g. in Incubator, takes interesting stories from queue and  completes them promptly,  takes responsibility for making the  project succeed, takes initiative)
		* makes excellent presentation to class about homework solutions
		* asks questions of teacher and other students that lead to deeper insights

	* "B" participation:
		* participates in class, sometimes needs to be asked to contribute
		* completes group work as required, but doesn't take responsibility for making sure the group projects gets completed well
		* makes clear presentations to class, but not inspiring presentations

	* "C" participation:
		* for the most part only participates if asked by a teacher
		* does not reliably complete work on group projects, blames others
		* class presentations of homework are somewhat confusing
		* asks questions that are off-topic or display lack of attention the discussion, distracts the class
		* Is often late, or not attending to what's going on in class

	* "D" participation:
		* we'll let you know if you are performing at a D or lower level!!!
* *Homeworks*
	* "A" homeworks
		* completes all of the homework assignments on time
		* blog posts are well-written and insightful, often linking with other closely related resources
		* code examples are clean and well-commented, illustrating clever algorithms clearly described and coded
		* Doesn't let obstacles get in the way, creatively and effectively searches for solutions and shares with the class

	* "B" homeworks
		* completes homework generally completed on time
		* blog posts address the issues but don't make bigger connections
		* code examples work correctly but are not elegant and beautifully commented
		* Often uses own resourcefulness to overcome obstacles, but may need to be prodded

	* "C" homeworks
		* homeworks are often late
		* blog posts are poorly written or miss the point of the article
		* code examples often have bugs and/or are poorly commented
		* Needs a lot of handholding to overcome obstacles for which solutions are readily available

	* "D" homeworks
		* we'll let you know if you are performing a "D" or lower level!
