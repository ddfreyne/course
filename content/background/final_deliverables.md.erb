##### Summary

Take a look at <%= tbd %> where I explain how the incubator project team results will be assessed. As you know they account for 1/3 of your grade. This will be a team assessment, so there is no formal per-team member assessment. 

There are two project deliverables. One is a Poster, and the second one is one of three options. Don't be scared by all the words below, I am just trying to be clear and detailed. Questions are welcome!

Remember, 9 out of 10 startups fail. It is not expected that each project yields something that merits investment. The deliverables are designed to work with any possible outcome!

##### Final Deliverable #1: Poster (+ handout)

On <%= tbd %> we will have a Showcase where Outside Experts (tm) will have a chance to look and ask questions and give feedback on your various posters and handouts.

The Experts will ask to review the projects as if they were looking for angel funding. The review will not be based solely on what is on the poster and handout, but from conversation with you. They will assess and vote based on the idea itself, the business model, the degree and quality of thinking, the understanding of the market and the customer, all this based on getting outside the building, and of course how impressed they are with your ability to deliver. There will be a cool prize raffled among the top vote getters.

Your poster doesn't have to contain every detail of your project. Rather it should be an eye catcher that will get a visitor to come to you and learn more, ask questions and give you feedback. So think about the headline, the graphics, and the content in that context.

You should have some kind of handout with the further details about your project to give out to people interested. One or two double sided sheet should be about right. This information will come right out of your second deliverable. I have attached two examples, but I don't expect yours to be like that, they are just to give you an idea.

On the last day of class, in class, we will have a dry run. All students will put up their posters and wander around to look at the other posters. There will be stacks of feedback forms for you to fill out on whatever posters interest you. Each team will collect the feedback sheets and collate them and share the feedback with the class.

#####Final Deliverable #2 (only do one of the options)

* *option 1*: Create a Kickstarter or HubRocket (or other) crowdsource campaign. It is up to you whether you submit it or not. If you do this, be serious about it and do a great job. A video is required.
* *option 2:* Submit a detailed posting to <%= tbd %> Assume of course that the reader has not seen or heard any of the work you did before. A Video is optional but desirable. Much/most of this content will come from your previous deliverables, including:
	* elevator pitch and positioning
	* target market and market size guestimates
	* story of how the different hypotheses evolved, what MVP(s) you created and which ones were proven or not proved
	* story of pivots done or contemplated
	* all the ways in which you went 'outside the building'
	* strategy for pricing and current thinking about the engine of growth
	* subjective notes about your experience
	* subjective notes about lessons learned

* option 3: This is most interesting to people who feel that their project in the end does not deserve to see the light of day in its current form. It's a retrospective of your project. For this option, you should write an article/paper/post/report. You can choose whatever format you like: you might want to write an article intended for publication; you can write an extensive blog post; or you might create a standard college paper or report that you 'hand in. In any event think of the length around 5-10 pages. The content should focus more on the process you went through,including:
	* what your original goals were
	* how you applied lean startup ideas
	* how you assess the way your team spent the time. 
	* did you pivot early enough?
	* did you miss signals that could have allowed you to make a course correction?
	* what parts of your original plan do you still believe in?
	* is there a pivot you would undertake if you had more time?
	* what are the lessons learned?
