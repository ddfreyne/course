## Hypothesis Testing

* Getting out of the building
* You don't know anything!
* Show and Tell as appropriate
* Not just product questions: 
	* pricing
	* naming
	* problem statement
	* technology
* Some techniques (with examples)
	* Google form/survey
	* LinkedIn groups
	* Find out who you know and who they know
	* Think about: where do they congregate?
* Target varies depending on the type of question!
