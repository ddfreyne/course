title: The Value Proposition

### Value Proposition

*	Positioning and Value Proposition and Elevator Pitch
*	All different sides of the same coin, used differently
*	How to construct an elevator pitch

#### Value Proposition Statement

"For tourists visiting a new destination, who want to supplement their experience with local knowledge, NewProd offers local and knowledgable audio guides automatically based on location"

"For local professional and non-professional guides, Newprod is a way for them to discover new paying customers by providing location based audio tour segments which produce leads and also bolster reputation."

*	The sentence specifically answers some key questions:
	*	Who is it for?
	*	What is their problem, what is the job their looking to hire a product for?
	*	What is the proposed solution?
	*	How does it achieve that?

Notice that this is an 'internal' statement, never meant to be shown to customers or even investors.

In this case we have two sentences because there are two distinctive markets. This raises very interesting pricing questions.

#### Elevator Pitch

An elevator pitch is meant to be spoken or read to a potential investor or board member.
