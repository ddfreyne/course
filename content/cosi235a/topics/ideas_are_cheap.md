* *Ideas are cheap*
	* Everyone has a million ideas
	* Few know how to turn the idea into a successful product or service
		* What is your definition of 'successful?'
	* 90/10 Rule
	* (Almost) always gain more from sharing your idea and getting feedback
		* vs. keeping it secret for imagined competitive advantage
	* If your idea is so simple that a 10 minute description is enough to allow someone else to beat you.... then your idea wasn't really worth that much anyway!
