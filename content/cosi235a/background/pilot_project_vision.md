## Vision for "Pilot Project"

For the first 5 weeks of the course we will focused on the "Lean Startup" approach to validating a vision for a project, pivoting as necessary to achieve a product-market fit. We will divide students into two groups and each group will work independently to use the process on the vision for a product called "P2PTours"

### PTPTours - Peer to Peer Tours

> *"Our vision is that using just a cellphone, travelers can now get access to a huge and wonderful collection of locally recorded experts for free or for a nominal fee.*

> *Simply walk into St. Peter's Square and choose which local expert you want to listen to: a historian? A priest? An architect? A chef? Each one will have their unique perspective and will enhance your visit in their own unique way!*
