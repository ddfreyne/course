## Homework

* The homework due for a particular lecture is always listed at the top of the page for that day.
* Written homework is submitted as a blog post on Piazza, categorized as "blog" (duh)
* Project progress reports are due weekly. Those are also posted on Piazza, categorized as "progress"

### Homework rough sketches (which I will refines)

* Watch an episode "Shark Tank". What are some things that you think are realistic and some that you think are unrealistic. Take apart one of the pitches done by one of the entrepreneurs either because you think it is good or because it is really bad.
