#### Grading

I will try to give everyone constant and actionable feedback. I also expect you to be proactive if you are unclear about something or want to talk about anything. 

1. Class Participation (20%): This includes basic things like being in class when it starts, participating in the discussion, speaking up and contributing through blog posts and responses.

2. Product/Service (40%): How well did you and your team apply the Lean Startup techiniques and other concepts we covered to your product or service work. How well did you listen to feedback from prospects, experts and incorporate those ideas into your project. How good was your final deliverable?

3. xxx (20%)

4. yyy (20%)

#### Letter Grades

At the middle and end of the term you will receive letter grades. It's important to remember that a "B" is a totally reasonable grade (everyone always seems to forget this!) To help with that, here's a brief summary of how I think about each grade:

#### In class Participation

* "A" participation:
	* participates actively in class, without dominating the discussion asks insightful questions, makes illuminating remarks, listens to others and responds appropriately
	* works responsibly as a member of a group (e.g. in Incubator, takes interesting stories from queue and  completes them promptly,  takes responsibility for making the  project succeed, takes initiative)
	* makes excellent presentation to class about homework solutions
	* asks questions of teacher and other students that lead to deeper insights

* "B" participation:
	* participates in class, sometimes needs to be asked to contribute
	* completes group work as required, but doesn't take responsibility for making sure the group projects gets completed well
	* makes clear presentations to class, but not inspiring presentations

* "C" participation:
	* for the most part only participates if asked by a teacher
	* does not reliably complete work on group projects, blames others
	* class presentations of homework are somewhat confusing
	* asks questions that are off-topic or display lack of attention the discussion, distracts the class
	* Is often late, or not attending to what's going on in class

* "D" participation:
	* we'll let you know if you are performing at a D or lower level!!!

#### For Homework

* "A" homeworks
	* completes all of the homework assignments on time
	* blog posts are well-written and insightful, often linking with other closely related resources
	* code examples are clean and well-commented, illustrating clever algorithms clearly described and coded
	* Doesn't let obstacles get in the way, creatively and effectively searches for solutions and shares with the class

* "B" homeworks
	* completes homework generally completed on time
	* blog posts address the issues but don't make bigger connections
	* code examples work correctly but are not elegant and beautifully commented
	* Often uses own resourcefulness to overcome obstacles, but may need to be prodded

* "C" homeworks
	* homeworks are often late
	* blog posts are poorly written or miss the point of the article
	* code examples often have bugs and/or are poorly commented
	* Needs a lot of handholding to overcome obstacles for which solutions are readily available

* "D" homeworks
	* we'll let you know if you are performing a "D" or lower level!
