### Grading

I will try to give everyone constant and actionable feedback. I also expect you to be proactive if you are unclear about something or want to talk about anything. 

1. Class Participation (20%): This includes basic things like being in class when it starts, participating in the discussion, speaking up and contributing through blog posts and responses.

2. Product/Service (40%): How well did you and your team apply the Lean Startup techiniques and other concepts we covered to your product or service work. How well did you listen to feedback from prospects, experts and incorporate those ideas into your project. How good was your final deliverable?
