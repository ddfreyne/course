### Detailed Framework

The term is divided into chunks which I call frames (play on the word "framework"). There are four major frames. In the Pilot frame we will rapidly go through the leann startup process as applied to the Pilot product, "Peer-to-peer Location Aware Travel Guide". 

Then we will break into teams of 2 or 3 and work on individual projects of your own invention. That work will be structured and guided in 3 frames.
