### Welcome to COSI 235A - IT Entrepreneurship

The course this fall has been fully updated and incorporates two key new components. 

1. We will go in-depth on the "Lean Startup" model of entrepreneurship. This model is strongly focused on rapid iterations and validated learning. We will "go outside the building" to confirm (or refute) our hypotheses. A hypothesis in this context is a belief about the business we are consideringn starting up. A belief about a problem a user has, or a price they are willing to pay.
2. We will cycle twice through the Lean Startup process. First, during 4 weeks, we will rapidly learn the approach and terminology while attacking a product concept that I will supply (I hope you like it :). We will divide the class into two teams, and each one will work semi-independently on fleshing out the business plan. The second time through, students will apply the same process on a product of their own conception. We will form 2-3 person teams, ideate, validate, design, and document a full business model for the product, up to and including an actual validated prototype.(By the way, the prototypes and business models are the starting point of the companion course, "Software Engineering for IT Entrepreneurs which I will be teaching in the Spring.")

#### Other topics

* We will learn and practice how to create static and working prototypes which are critical in the process of validated learning
* We will explore basic finance as it applies to startups, especially as it relates to Venture Capital and company financing, as well as pricing and sustainability.

#### Speaker Series

Every (other?) week there will be an invited speaker during class. These will be local entrepreneurs, CEOs and CTOs who will give their personal perspectives, insights and stories.
